# =========================== Try , except , Exception handling ===========================

# if our code runs prperly but at some point our code face some error then the whole program is stop but we want to run our whole 
# program with error 
# At this condiotion we use try , except 

# for example

# "Below this code we print x but we can not define x so it will through error and cant go next"

try:
    print(x)
except:
    print("The next code is very important we must run this program")


# now with the help of try and except condition it will save error and execute the next program
