# Creating simple calculator


print("Enter you first number")
first = input()

# input is a simple function for taking value from user like cin in c++


print("Enter your second numvber")
second = input()


# We have to write "int" befor adding to two values of function because input function takes values in "string" by default... so we have to typecast it

print ("Sum is = " ,int(first) + int(second) + 2)
