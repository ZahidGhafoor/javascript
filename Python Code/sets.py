# ================================== Sets ===================================

# set is a datatype like "list" to add unique value in set

# Now create a simple set

Zahid = set()
# l=[1,2,3,4,5]

# Zahid=set(l)

# print(type(Zahid))

# print(Zahid)

Zahid.add(6)

Zahid.remove(6)

# set have many built in functions but we now don't need to go in depth but we can read them we need



print(Zahid)

z={1,2,3,4,5,6}

print(type(z))
