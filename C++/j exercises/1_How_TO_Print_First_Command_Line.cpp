    DEFINE COMPUTER PROGRAMING:
        fic computingComputer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a speci result.
    
   
   
    DEFINE PROGRAMING LANGUAGE:
        A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.
        here are Two level of Programming Language:
            1. High Level Programming Language.
            2. Low level Programing language.

                HIGH LEVEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:
                    A high-level language is a programming language designed to simplify computer programming. It is "high-level" since it is several steps removed from the actual code run on a computer's processor. High-level source code contains easy-to-read syntax that is later converted into a low-level language, which can be recognized and run by a specific CPU.
                    EG. Python, C++, PhP ETC.

                LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:
                    A low-level language is a type of programming language that contains basic instructions recognized by a computer. Unlike high-level languages used by software developers, low-level code is often cryptic and not human-readable. Two common types of low-level programming languages are assembly language and machine language.

   
   
    DEFINE IDE (integrated development environment):
        An integrated development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.

   
   
    DEFINE COMPILER:
        A compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language into another language. The name compiler is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language to create an executable program.
        EG. C, C++, JAVA need to compie to execute.

    DEFINE INTERPRETER:
        In computer science, an interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.
        EG. PYTHON, PHP, RUBY, PERL ETC. use interpreter



                                //////                     C++ LANGUAGE                     \\\\\\

        C++ is a high-level programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language.
        The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
        It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
